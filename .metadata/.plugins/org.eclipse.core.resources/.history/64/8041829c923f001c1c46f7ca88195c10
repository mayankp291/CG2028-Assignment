@Register map
@R0 - N, returns class
@R1 - points
@R2 - label
@R3 - sample
@R4 - register for storing intermediate variables for euclidean distance
@R5 - register for storing intermediate variables for euclidean distance
@R6 - intermediate pointer for storage
@R7 - intermediate pointer for extracting x value from array
@R8 - intermediate pointer for extracting y value from array

classification:
@ PUSH / save (only those) registers which are modified by your function
		PUSH {R1-R8,R14}
@ parameter registers need not be saved.

@ write asm function body here

@ extract sample_x
LDR R6, =sample_x, #4	@prepare r6 to load sample_y
STR R3, [R6]


@ branch to GET_EUCLIDEAN TO check if curr_distance is smaller than min_distance
		@BL GET_EUCLIDEAN

@ increment count, check if count == N. if so, go to next line

@ prepare value to return (class) to C program in R0
@ the #5 here is an arbitrary result

		MOVW R0, #5
@ POP / restore original register values. DO NOT save or restore R0. Why?
		POP {R1-R8,R14}
@ return to C program
		BX	LR

@ you could write your code without SUBROUTINE
GET_EUCLIDEAN:

		BX LR

@label: .word value
count: .word 0	@declares count = 0, used for stopping iteration
min_distance: .word 0xFFFFFFFF	@initialises min distance to max value


@.lcomm label num_bytes
.lcomm sample_x 4
.lcomm sample_y 4
