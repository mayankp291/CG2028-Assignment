@Register map
@R0 - N, returns class
@R1 - points
@R2 - label
@R3 - sample
@R4 - register for storing intermediate variables for euclidean distance
@R5 - register for storing intermediate variables for euclidean distance
@R6 -
@....

classification:
@ PUSH / save (only those) registers which are modified by your function
		PUSH {R1-R4,R14}
@ parameter registers need not be saved.

@ write asm function body here

@ branch to SUBROUTINE for illustration only
		BL GET_EUCLIDEAN
@ prepare value to return (class) to C program in R0
@ the #5 here is an arbitrary result
		MOVW R0, #200
@ POP / restore original register values. DO NOT save or restore R0. Why?
		POP {R1-R4,R14}
@ return to C program
		BX	LR

@ you could write your code without SUBROUTINE
GET_EUCLIDEAN:

		BX LR

@label: .word value
count: .word 0	@declares count = 0, used for stopping iteration
min_distance: .word 0xFFFFFFFF	@initialises min distance to max value


@.lcomm label num_bytes
.lcomm sample_x 4 @ to store x coordinates of sample
.lcomm sample_y 4 @ to store y coordinates of sample
