@Register map
@R0 - N, returns class
@R1 - points
@R2 - label
@R3 - sample
@R4 - register for calculation
@R5 - register for calculation
@R6 - general purpose register for writing/ reading
@R7 - general purpose register for writing/ reading
@R8 - intermediate register for storing count
@R9 - pointer to read points

classification:
@ PUSH / save (only those) registers which are modified by your function
		PUSH {R1-R9,R14}
@ parameter registers need not be saved.

@ write asm function body here

@ initialise current class to 0
LDR R6,=curr_class	@extract value of x
MOV R7, #0
STR R7, [R6]

@ extract N into register 8 for comparison later.
LDR R8, [R0] @extract N into R8

@ extract sample_x
LDR R7, [R3]	@extract value of x
LDR R6, =sample_x
STR R7, [R6]

@ extract sample_y
LDR R7, [R3,#4]	@extract value of y
LDR R6, =sample_y
STR R7, [R6]

@ main chunk to calculate min_distance
LOOP:
	BL GET_POINT	@ increment pointer to reference NEXT point!
	BL GET_EUCLIDEAN
	SUBS R8, #1
	BNE LOOP

@ prepare value to return (class) to C program in R0
BL RETURN_VALUE

@ POP / restore original register values. DO NOT save or restore R0. Why?
POP {R1-R9,R14}

@ return to C program
BX	LR

@gets the euclidean distance of current point of reference and sample.
GET_EUCLIDEAN:

@ extract point_x
	LDR R6, =point_x
	STR R9, [R6]
@ extract point_y
	LDR R7, [R9,#4]	@extract value of y
	LDR R6, =point_y
	STR R7, [R6]

		BX LR

@sets R0 to the class
RETURN_VALUE:
		LDR R7,=point_x	@gets current class reading (most updated)
		LDR R0, [R7]
		BX LR

@increments R1
GET_POINT:
	LDR R9, [R1]	@reads current value
	BX LR

@label: .word value


@.lcomm label num_bytes - these values are important and thus are stored as static variables
.lcomm sample_x 4	@x coordinate of a particular sample (not modified in calculations)
.lcomm sample_y 4	@y coordinate of a particular sample (not modified in calculations)

.lcomm point_x 4	@x coordinate of a reference point (to be modifed (N - 1) times)
.lcomm point_y 4	@y coordinate of a reference point (to be modified (N - 1) times)
.lcomm curr_label 1 @current label of the point of refernece

.lcomm curr_distance 4
.lcomm min_distance 4
.lcomm curr_class 1
