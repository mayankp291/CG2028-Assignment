# CG2028 Assignment 21/22 Semester 1
ARM Assembly program to classify a point using k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
The input consists of the k closest training examples in a data set. In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a
plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically
small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
